The best possible solution would yield an AUC of 1 which means we would classify all positive samples correctly without getting any false positives. \n",

    "**220k training images and 57k evaluation images.** The dataset is a subset of the [PCam dataset](https://github.com/basveeling/pcam) and the only difference between these two is that all duplicate images have been removed. The PCam dataset is derived from the [Camelyon16 Challenge dataset](https://camelyon16.grand-challenge.org/Data/) which contains 400 H&E stained whole slide images of sentinel lymph node sections that were acquired and digitized at 2 different centers using a 40x objective. The PCam's dataset including this one uses 10x undersampling to increase the field of view, which gives the resultant pixel resolution of 2.43 microns.\n",

    "According to the data description, there is a 50/50 balance between positive and negative examples in the training and test splits. However, **the training distribution seems to be 60/40 (negatives/positives)**. A positive label means that there is at least one pixel of tumor tissue in the center region (32 x 32px) of the image. **Tumor tissue in the outer region of the patch does not influence the label.** This means that a negatively labeled image could contain metastases in the outer region. Thus, it would be a good idea to crop the images to the center region.\n",

The inspection was performed by an experienced technician (Q.M. and N.S. for UMCU, M.H. or R.vd.L. for the other centers) to assess the quality of the scan; when in doubt, a pathologist was consulted on whether scanning issues might affect diagnosis.\n",
